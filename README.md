My name is Nicolas DeMilio, I am a senior here at SUNY New Paltz. I have practiced Jiu Jitsu for the past 7 years of my life. This past summer I've commited myself to learning Node.js and React with typescript. Now I am ready to polish those skills up to learn the concepts. 

I have taken a functional programming course where I've made a program that estimates the price of an area based jobs such as sheet rock installation, flooring installation and finish, and foundation pouring. I implemented it using a TUI. 
Over the Summer I started making a website for a barbershop and I used vanilla html, css, and js. I also set up a backend mongodb service which I used node js to set up. I'm currently learning how to connect the two.
I See my self using this course to learn how to set up full stack websites for small businesses.
