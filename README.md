# Nicolas DeMilio

I am a senior here at SUNY New Paltz. I have practiced Jiu Jitsu for the past 7 years of my life.

This past summer, I committed myself to learning Node.js and React with TypeScript. Now, I am ready to polish those skills and dive deeper into the concepts of web development.

## Experience

I have taken a functional programming course where I developed a program to estimate the price of various area-based jobs, such as:
- Sheet rock installation
- Flooring installation and finish
- Foundation pouring

I implemented this using a TUI (Text User Interface).  

In the class assembly and architecture we were asked to finish developing an assembly language interpreter and convert it to machine code for the provided lcc to understand.

Over the summer, I started working on a website for a barbershop, using:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and started typescript with react 
- A backend with MongoDB and Node.js  

I am currently learning how to connect the frontend and backend.

## Goals

I see myself using this course to learn how to set up full-stack websites for small businesses.
